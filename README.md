# [REMWaste Challenge](https://xqq6hz-5173.csb.app/)

I decided to tackle this challenge using the React + TypeScript + Vite toolkit, along with Tailwind CSS to simplify the application's styling - even though it might not be the cleanest approach (but that's a discussion for another time). I populated the state storing the options using the options.json file where I put the input you provided. For the functionality, I needed to declare a state to store the selected option following the click event. Based on this state, combined with the 'forbidden' property within each option, I conditionally rendered or styled the application's HTML as needed.
